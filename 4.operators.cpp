/*
Operator represents an action. For example + is an operator that represents addition. An operator works on two or more operands and produce an output. For example 3+4+5 here + operator works on three operands and produce 12 as output.

    Types of Operators in C++
1) Basic Arithmetic Operators
2) Assignment Operators
3) Auto-increment and Auto-decrement Operators
4) Logical Operators
5) Comparison (relational) operators
6) Bitwise Operators
7) Ternary Operator

    1) Basic Arithmetic Operators
+	Addition
-	Subtraction
*	Multiplication
/	Division
%	Modulus
Note: Modulo operator returns remainder, for example 20 % 5 would return 0

%=	Performs modulus using two operands and assign the result to left operand

&&	Logical AND

b1||b2 will return false if both b1 and b2 are false else it would return true.

!b1 would return the opposite of b1, that means it would be true if b1 is false and it would return false if b1 is true.

>=	Checks if the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, if yes then condition becomes true.

/*
    6) Bitwise Operators
&	Binary AND Operator copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands
|	Binary OR Operator copies a bit if it exists in either operand
^	Binary XOR Operator copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both
~	Binary Ones Complement Operator is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits
<<	Binary Left Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand
>>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand


num1 & num2 compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1 if both bits are equal, else it returns 0. In our case it would return: 2 which is 00000010 because in the binary form of num1 and num2 only second last bits are matching.

num1 | num2 compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1 if either bit is 1, else it returns 0. In our case it would return 31 which is 00011111

num1 ^ num2 compares corresponding bits of num1 and num2 and generates 1 if they are not equal, else it returns 0. In our example it would return 29 which is equivalent to 00011101

~num1 is a complement operator that just changes the bit from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0. In our example it would return -12 which is signed 8 bit equivalent to 11110100

num1 << 2 is left shift operator that moves the bits to the left, discards the far left bit, and assigns the rightmost bit a value of 0. In our case output is 44 which is equivalent to 00101100

Note: In the example below we are providing 2 at the right side of this shift operator that is the reason bits are moving two places to the left side. We can change this number and bits would be moved by the number of bits specified on the right side of the operator. Same applies to the right side operator.

num1 >> 2 is right shift operator that moves the bits to the right, discards the far right bit, and assigns the leftmost bit a value of 0. In our case output is 2 which is equivalent to 00000010

/*
    7) Ternary Operator
The ternary operator is a conditional operator that evaluates something based on a condition being true or false. It can be used as a one line if-then-else statement. The general form is:
    Syntax:

variable num1 = (expression) ? value if true : value if false

If the expression results true then the first value before the colon (:) is assigned to the variable num1 else the second value is assigned to the num1.
